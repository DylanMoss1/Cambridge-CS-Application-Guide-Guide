Coming soon!

<!-- This section includes two mock interviews I created, each with accompanying question sheets, hint sheets, and answer sheets. While the questions are not taken from actual interviews, they closely resemble the types of questions that are likely to appear.

**Before looking at these interviews, please read the rest of this page to help you make the most of the questions provided.**

These interviews are intentionally challenging, and you're not expected to complete all the questions within the allotted time. The focus is less on how many questions you answer and more on how you approach and respond to unfamiliar problems.

If you share these interview questions, please credit this website page. 

### Interview 1
    
[Questions](interview-1-questions.pdf), [Hints](interview-1-hints.pdf), [Answers](interview-1-answers.pdf)

- Contains 1 computer science question (split up into 4 parts). 
- Can be treated as a pre-reading interview (the first 2 pages are pre-reading). 
- Expected to take around 45 mins. 

### Interview 2

[Questions](interview-2-questions.pdf), [Hints](interview-2-hints.pdf), [Answers](interview-2-answers.pdf)

- Contains 3 maths-based questions.
- Knowledge of mathematical induction is required. 
- Expected to take around 35 mins. 

## How to Use these Questions 

How you use these questions is entirely up to you, but here are some tips to help you get the most out of them.

- **Mock interview environment:** Try to complete these questions in a mock interview environment. Working through the questions alone in silence won't help you learn important interview skills such as working through a problem with another person, and speaking aloud your thoughts as you go along. 
- **Find someone to interview you:** Try to find someone (ideally someone older than you from a computer science / maths background) to interview you. Failing this, try to find a peer from school, fellow computer science university applicants, or a teacher to interview you instead. If you cannot find someone to interview you, then record yourself solving the problem and speaking your thoughts out loud as if you were in an interview. 
- **Ask your interviewer to prepare:** If your mock interview is the first time the interviewer sees the questions, then they likely won't be able to guide you through the interview properly -- ask them to look through the questions, hints, and answers in advance. They should never tell you the answer directly, but instead gradually  drop hints if you get stuck (see these mock interviews [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I03cCH-TG_w) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7XwKVCBPfM) for an example of what this looks like).
- **Put yourself in interview condition:** This is a great chance to prepare what it is like taking a real interview. Try setting up full interview conditions: put up a clock timer, sit in a room alone with just you and an interview or conduct the interview online, give yourself scrap paper or a drawing tablet to work out your ideas on, remove all other distractions. 
- **Always keep going:** Given that this isn't a real interview, it might be tempting to break the illusion of the interview if you get stuck (especially if you are being interviewed by a friend or peer). However, a large part of the interview is seeing how you react when you are stuck on a problem -- you'll get the most out of the interview if you commit to it as if it were real. 
- **You are not expected to finish:** You are not expected to finish all parts of all interviews in the time: most successful candidates do not! If you are on a question for a disproportionate amount of time, the interviewer should move on and then come back to the question at the end if you have time. It is better to attempt all parts of the interview, than to complete only half the interview and not look at the remaining question(s).  
- **Record the interview:** If you have permission from the interviewer, record the interview and watch it back later. This helps you understand what you look like from the interviewer’s perspective.

## Interview Preparation Advice

### What Are Interviews Looking For? 

While interviews are there to test your technical aptitude, arguably more importantly they are there to test how you think. Admissions officers only care so much about how much stuff you know, as the course is designed to teach you the knowledge you need. What they are often really looking for is how teachable you are: are you the type of person who would learn well and thrive in this environemnt. In fact, Cambridge interviews often reflect supervisions. 

### Understand Your Interview Type 

Be aware that different colleges conduct interviews different to each other. Some colleges ask a mix of personal statement, computer science, and mathematics questions, other colleges might focus entirely on maths questions, and some colleges have pre-reading material to review before the interview. Colleges should hopefully tell you what type of interview they will be conducting when you are invited to interview, but if not then try reaching out to current students or the college's admissions team for more information. 

### What To Practice 

Make sure you focus on your maths skills, and have completed at least the A level maths course (or equivilant) before your interview. Skills such as geometry, graph sketching, logical reasoning, series, and probability / statistics commonly appear in interviews. I would also recommend revising how to solve recursive functions and mathematical induction, as these are common skills required in interviews. 

While most colleges don't explicitly require computer science knowledge, some of the questions asked have a focus on algorithms which make them much easier to complete if you have programmed previously. I would recommend knowing at least the basics of a programming language (such as Python) including functions, for loops, while loops, and IO inputs/outputs. As well as some computer science concepts such as stacks, queues, stack machines, assembly language, and hashing.
