Coming soon!

<!-- **This advice is aimed at the new personal statement format, for 2026 entry onwards. Information about this new format can be found [here](https://www.ucas.com/applying/applying-university/writing-your-personal-statement/new-personal-statement-2026-entry).**

# Disclaimer 

This advice is based purely on my own experience, having written my own successful personal statement, and having reviewed dozens of personal statements from potential applicants. This is my subjective view on what makes a personal statement informative and interesting.

I will focus primarily on computer science personal statements for Cambridge / Oxford / Imperial, however much of this advice transfers to other courses and universities. 

**My own personal statement (which successfully gained me admission to computer science at Cambridge University, 2020 entry) can be found [here](/ps/my_ps).** -->

<!-- # Prerequisites

There are many articles online about how to write a computer science PS, such as: 
- [UCAS (compsci PS advice)](https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/personal-statement-guides/personal-statement-advice-computer-science)
- [The Student Room (compsci PS advice)](https://www.theuniguide.co.uk/advice/personal-statements/writing-a-computer-science-personal-statement-expert-advice-from-universities)
- [The Student Room (general PS advice)](https://www.theuniguide.co.uk/advice/personal-statements/writing-your-personal-statement)
- [Studential (compsci PS examples)](https://www.studential.com/personal-statement-examples/computer-science-personal-statement-examples)
- [Oxford Computer Science Department (compsci PS advice)](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/how_to_apply/personal-statement.html)

I will assume you have some previously researched PS advice (such as by reading some of these articles). This should teach you the basics of what should be included in a personal statement, and what admissions officers are looking for. Even though these articles are written for the old PS format, much of the advice is still applicable. 

**This guide aims to extend the information found in these articles by providing actionable advice with practical examples.** -->

<!-- # Overview 

Many online guides offer general advice on writing personal statements. While these can be helpful for understanding what admission officers are typically looking for, I often find the guidance too generic, or overly focused on what _not_ to include (instead of talking about what you should include). This guide aims to extend the information found in these articles by providing actionable advice with practical examples.

**In my opinion, the purpose of a personal statement is to demonstrate your passion, dedication, and suitability for studying computer science:** 
- Convey your genuine passion for computer science, and show that you're eager to explore it beyond the confines of your school curriculum. 
- Highlight your dedication: have you pursued difficult challenges or independent learning out of personal motivation? 
- Demonstrate that you are well-suited to studying the subject at university, by engaging with unfamiliar topics, thinking critically, and applying your knowledge in new contexts.

This guide covers what sorts of projects and achievements you might wish to include, and how to write about them in a way which best conveys your passion, dedication, and suitability. These topics are split into the following three sections: 
- [What sorts of projects and achievements you should include](/ps/#what-to-include)
- [How to write about your projects and achievements](/ps/#how-to-write-your-ps)
- [How to approach the three PS questions](/ps/#the-three-ps-questions)

# What to Include 

**In this guide, I use the word _project_ very generally to describe any challenge you have undertaken related to computer science.** 

These are typically challenges you have taken on your own accord, outside of the school curriculum. However, A-level coursework or EPQs might fall into this category. Projects can refer to a wide range of challenges, such as: 
- Researching new topic areas through textbooks, online lectures, or YouTube videos 
- Programming projects / hardware projects 
- Academic competitions such as olympiads 
- Participating in events and communities (such as hackathons, clubs, and online forums)
- Tackling online challenges (such as Kaggle, Advent of Code, and Project Euler)

Projects are incredibly important, as they are the best and easiest way to demonstrate your passion and dedication for computer science. It is much more effective to show practical examples of how you have engaged and delved into your subject, compared to simply writing about how interested you are in computer science. 

### How to Find Projects to Complete 

The problem with finding projects is that the field of computer science is huge. It is often difficult for people to approach unfamiliar topics and discover what interests them. Even if you do find a topic that interests you, turning this into a stand-alone project that you can talk about on your PS is difficult. 

**[This page](/ps/project_inspiration) offers an overview of various topics within computer science, along with inspiration and practical project ideas to help you get started.**

I highly recommend trying to find projects that genuinely interest you, rather than projects that appear more "impressive". Projects you have a personal connection with allow you to convey your passion for the subject much more deeply, and often lead to more interesting conversations during interviews.

The best way to find these sorts of projects is to solve a personal problem. The problem can be small and insignificant, but it does not matter as long as it is personal! 
- Do you and your friends play online role-playing games and want to quickly generate and share character profile sheets? Try creating a small website that lets you do this! 
- Are you fed up with switching off lights in your room when you leave the room? Set up a camera which detects movements, and hook it up to a smart plug to turn off the lights when you leave the room.
- Are you interested by how fractals work? Try researching the mathematics behind fractals, and designing your own formulas to develop new fractals. 
- Do you and your classmates find it annoying to find questions on specific topics in past exam papers? Try automatically extracting keywords from questions in your past papers, which can be looked up using a search box. 
- Are you interested in the underlying mechanics of machine learning? Try finding an YouTube video series which describe the mathematics of neural networks and backpropagation.  
- Are you and your friends obsessed with a new game at school? Create an app which lets you log-on and keep track of your friends scores. 
- Are you interested in how well your favourite sports teams have performed over the last year? Find / scrape an online website with this information, and create live graph plots to keep track of their statistics. 
- Are you interested in solving programming problems. Check out coding challenge websites such as Advent of Code, Project Euler, Leetcode, Hackerrank, and Codeforces. 
- Do you have a garden at home that you help tend to? Can you put in PH / moisture / temperature meters into the soil to track these readings in real-time? 

Some of the most valuable projects are those where you don’t begin with the intention of learning specific skills. Instead, you dive into a task and, as challenges arise, you’re pushed to learn and adapt in order to overcome them.

As you go along, try to keep a record of what you have learnt, what challenges you encountered, and what went right / wrong. These notes will be very useful when you come to writing up your PS, as you may have forgotten most of this information by that time. 

Some key information to note down includes: 
- Was your project used by you / anyone else? 
- Did it effectively solve the problem it set out to tackle?
- Did it challenge / shape your understanding of an area in computer science? 
- What was a trade-off you had to make along the way (e.g. simplicity vs versatility)
- What technical / non-technical skills did it teach you? 

As a side-note, AI has become an incredibly powerful tool for writing code. However, relying on it to write large portions of code for you can be a risky trap, as you lose out on a valuable chance to learn new things.

The true value of these projects lies not in the final outcome, but in the learning journey you undertake along the way. As a general rule, it's fine to use AI assistants if you wish to, as long as you can explain every line of code it has written. Imagine someone questioning you on each line of code: if you can't justify why it was written that way then you probably don't understand it well enough. 

### Completing Large Projects

I highly recommend including many small projects on your PS, as well as one or two larger projects where you dive deep into a specific area of computer science. For example, this could be a research project or a larger programming project. 

Unlike the previous section, you should set out more concrete goals and criteria for this project, as well as a dedicated chunk of time (at least 2 weeks). However, once again, this should be a topic you are genuinly interested in and want to learn more about. 

Larger project examples include: 
- Do you have friends or family working in research (such as doing a PhD)? Try reaching out to them, asking if they need any help developing programs to aid with their research. For example, if they are running experiments, could you write a program which interprets their results and displays their data in graphs and plots? 
- 

Large projects like this are difficult, so do not worry if you struggle or are duanted by the scale of the challenge. Try completing a small, well-defined section of the problem first, and building out from there. 

For example, if I were completing the first project from the list above, I would schedule a call with the person doing the research project to better understand their requirements and the field they are working in. I would then get these requirements down on paper, and check it with them to ensure you are both on the same page. I would then try to identify the core problem (such as a program which turns their results into useful data which can be plotted). This might involve some domain-specific knowledge, so don't be afraid of learning the basics of a new field to give yourself useful context to take on this task. Then try to complete a small proof-of-concept to complete this core problem and show it to them. If they are satisfied, then develop the surrounding code so that they can easily use your tools...

# The Three PS Questions 

Please see the [UCAS website](https://www.ucas.com/applying/applying-to-university/writing-your-personal-statement/the-new-personal-statement-for-2026) for more details regarding the three PS questions. But to summarise, the three questions are: 
- **Question 1:** Why do you want to study this course or subject? 
- **Question 2:** How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject? 
- **Question 3:** What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?  -->




<!-- 







There are many online guides which provide general advice about how to approach writing personal statements. While these are useful to understand what sorts of things examiners are looking for, I often find the advice too generic, or that they talk about what not to include rather than what to include. 


Personal statements 

This page is split into three sections. The first section covers what sorts of projects and achievements you should include in your personal statement. This is especially helpful if your PS deadline is still a long way off, as it can provide inspiration for the kinds of projects you can pursue in the meantime to better prepare when you start writing.

The second section covers how to write about your projects and achievements. I share my three main tips on how to turn a bullet point list into a compelling personal statement. 

The third section focuses on how to answer the three PS questions. 






However, I find many of these articles frustrating as they provide generic advice and describe what not to do, but few describe what you should do.

The point of this guide is to take some of the generic advice from these articles, and turn them into actionable steps to improve your personal statement.

For example, the UCAS compsci PS advice article advises applicants to create a strong opening which demonstrates your enthusiasm for computer science, without using cliche openings (such as when you first got your first computer, or when you wrote your first program). However, it does not tell you what you should be doing instead!

I will structure this guide starting with general advise, then providing more details for each of the three personal statement questions: 
Question 1: Why do you want to study this course or subject?
Question 2: How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?
Question 3: What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?

I will provide generic advice (often found in PS advice articles) in italics, followed by my own advice on ways to implement this advice into your PS with actionable steps. 
General Advice
Turn Your PS Into a Story 

“Structure your PS in an interesting way”

The single most important advice I can give is to treat your PS as a story: instead of listing out your achievements, you should try and connect them into a narrative (I did X, which inspired me to do Y, which taught me Z, …). 

This narrative does not need to reflect your actual journey! It is much more important to create an interesting and compelling story, than it is to give an accurate story of your journey (as long as you have done all the things you say you have done).

Treating your PS as a story is beneficial for three reasons: 
A narrative is more interesting to read than a list of achievements (and will keep the admissions team more interested in your PS). 
This format allows you to demonstrate your motivation / passion: describing how different ideas / books / projects / etc. have inspired you to dig deeper into a topic is a great way to demonstrate genuine interest.  
This format encourages you to add depth to your PS: your projects are often less interesting to the admissions team than the skills you have learnt, how the project has inspired you, and how the project has shaped your understanding of computer science.

The key idea is to chain together your research / projects / books read / courses completed / etc. Try to summarise each chain with what you have learnt / how it has shaped your understanding of computer science. 

For example (bad): 
“When learning Python, I created a Battleships game using Pygame to teach me basic programming skills. I also learnt C# and Unity to build a basic 3D platformer game, which taught me how to use game engines. I then developed more complex games in Pygame such as a 2D platformer which used my own hand-made assets and music. I enjoyed incorporating these aspects into the game as it allowed me to customise it as my own. Using these skills, I also built a simple mobile game, which I published to the Android app store.” 

Even though this paragraph is technically impressive, the narrative is not compelling. It jumps from Pygame, to game engines, to Pygame with custom assets / music, to publishing apps to the app store. This reads more like a list of projects, rather than a journey of learning game development. 

Even if this was the journey you originally took, it would read better if some sentences were swapped around. This journey can be reframed in terms of motivations, challenges, and lessons learnt. It is often worthwhile to conclude your journey with a statement summarising your experience, and outlining your future intentions.

For example (good):
“When learning Python, I created a Battleships game using Pygame to teach me basic programming skills. I enjoyed the act of creating a game, especially customising game mechanics to make the game my own. This inspired me to develop a more complex ‘space-themed’ 2D platformer game using my own custom assets, music, and gameplay mechanics. Creating new gameplay mechanics, such as gravitating the player towards multiple asteroids at once, was incredibly difficult but rewarding to implement in Python. However, I often found myself limited by the physics capabilities of the Pygame game engine. To overcome this, I learnt C# and Unity — an industry-standard game engine — to handle the complex physics calculations I originally performed manually in Pygame. The culmination of these skills led me to develop an Android game, which taught me how to develop and test games on mobile phone emulators. I released the game on the Android app store, which taught me how to respond to player feedback, fix bugs, and release update cycles. I look forward to developing more games in the future; I have recently joined a student-led game development group to build upon my experience and contribute towards their project.” 
Cut Out the Fluff

“Avoid generic statements”

This piece of advice can be helpful, but I want to emphasise just how important it is. If you mention a statement which does not include a specific: skill, topic area, achievement, or project then it is usually fluff and can be cut out. The only exceptions are in the introduction, conclusion, or any opening / conclusive sentences in a paragraph.

For example (bad): 
“I researched machine learning by watching YouTube videos online, which taught me a lot about how neural networks work.”

Is bad because “machine learning” is too vague a topic area to be informative, and “how neural networks work” is not specific enough to describe what you have actually learnt. 

This entire sentence is meaningless fluff, and will likely be mostly ignored by an admissions team.

To make this sentence more meaningful, you should be specific in what you have done / learnt, and ideally tie it back to a tangible project you have done. 

For example (good): 
“I researched machine learning backpropagation algorithms through 3Blue1Brown’s YouTube series, which taught me how chained partial differentiation can be used to update neural network weights. This inspired me to create my own neural network from scratch in Python; I found it fascinating how simple perceptrons can exhibit such complex behaviour through simple linear algebra and differentiation alone.”

This specifies: what you did, where you learnt it, and what you got out of it. Tying it back to a personal project helps show you were genuinely interested in the topic, and provides even more concrete details about what you learn. 

This also follows the story format from before: “I researched A, which taught me B, which inspired me to do C, which shaped my understanding of computer science through D”. All of which is conveyed in only two sentences!
Trade-Offs Are Key

“Talk about what you have learnt from books / projects / courses / etc.”

This advice sounds useful on the surface, but it is difficult to talk about what you have learnt without regurgitating technical details that do not necessarily represent any deeper understanding.

For example (bad): 
“I created a booking system in Java, and learnt how to use inheritance and encapsulation to structure my code.” 

Even though “inheritance” and “encapsulation” are technical terms that make it sound like you understand how to program in Java, you could come up with this sentence by copying these terms from the internet. 

The key to conveying the depth of your understanding / learning is to discuss trade-offs (especially those in the context of your book / project / course / etc.).

For example (good): 
“I created a booking system in Java, but found that many different types of bookings shared common similarities. To structure my code, I created an abstract booking class which can be inherited by concrete classes for the different types of bookings. This avoided unnecessary code repetition, but required me to specify the core functionality of the abstract booking class in advance (to avoid conflict with sub-class behaviour). In the context of this project, this trade-off was worth it as the booking class’ behaviour was well-specified in advance. However, this may not necessarily hold in future projects where the booking class’ behaviour is subject to change (such as through changing project requirements).”

Here we employ all three techniques we have seen so far:
Story approach: “I did project A, but encountered problem/observation B, I resolved this with C, which gave the advantage D, but the disadvantage E, in the context of this project the advantage D outweighed the disadvantage E”.
Cut out the fluff: The terms “inheritance” and “encapsulation” are too vague without the context of how they are applied. Do not use words like these without specifying how they are applied to your project.
Trade-offs: To add depth to our explanation, I did not just explain more technical tool details (such as describing more Java concepts), or more technical project details (such as describing how the booking system works). I instead described the trade-offs I encountered, and how they tie into the tools and project.

If you have an opportunity, it is worth considering the project at a higher level. I start to do this in the above example, by considering how the project approach might change if the project had fixed vs changing requirements. 

If you have a personal project, you could consider the following questions as if you were building a real world project:
How would you scale the application to support multiple (and high volumes) of users? 
How would you structure your code if you were working with other people? 
How would you approach the problem if it had vague / changing requirements? 
Conclusion
To conclude, I advise you to incorporate the “story approach”, “cut out the fluff”, and “trade-offs” techniques into your PS. 

Cut out the fluff: This should help guide you on what you should and should not include in your PS (and which areas you should go into more depth).

Story approach: This should help you take the things that remain, and turn them into a compelling narrative. This will add further depth to your PS, and will help demonstrate your: skills, motivations, and passion. 

Trade-offs: Talking about trade-offs (in context) helps add even more depth to your narrative, and allows you to demonstrate your understanding of the topic. 

While these approaches may require many more characters, it is better to describe a few of your key projects in great detail, rather than many projects with surface-level detail. It is worth going into this level of detail, even if it means removing one of your less important achievements / projects / etc. 

Even though this advice seems most applicable to personal projects and research (question 3), it can really be applied to all three questions, as we will see below.
Approaching the Three Questions 
…
Questions 1
Why do you want to study this course or subject?

Questions 2
How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject?

Questions 3 
What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful?

Many people often ask me “what super curricular activities should I do?”. My initial answer is: “explore whatever interests you”. However, the field of computer science is huge, and it is quite hard for people to find what interests them. Even if people do find a field of interest, it is hard to turn that interest into a feasible stand-alone project, or to contribute to existing projects in that area. Hence, I have created a document containing inspiration for personal projects [here].  -->
